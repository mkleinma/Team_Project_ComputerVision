                <p>This project focuses on analyzing climate change-related content on Twitter (now X) using computer vision and social media analysis. Leveraging a dataset of 700,000 tweets from 2019, including images and user reactions, we aim to develop a framework for understanding public sentiment and engagement with climate change issues. Our approach involves three main components: image content analysis, assessment of tweets and image content, and the creation of a graphical user interface (GUI). Through detailed image analysis, sentiment assessment, and the correlation with user reactions, we aim to uncover patterns and trends that enhance traditional text analysis. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights from social media data to support climate action and research, contributing to more effective communication and mobilization efforts.</p>

                <p>The project is supervised by Prof. Margret Keuper and PhD Canidate Katharina Prasse of the Data and Web Science Group from the Unviersity of Mannheim. The students working on the project are Master students of Mannheim University in Data Science and Business Informatics.</p>
